# Data-Wrangling-Project-
Electricity generation in Europe over the years

## Overview of the dataset:

In this project I will use 3 datasets related to electricity data. I want to learn more about the electicity generation in European countries.

How does renewable energies have developed among electricity generation in Europe?

The top countries that produce energy from renewable sources and study if there's a relationship between it and the electricity wholesale price.

I will also look at numbers of demand per capita, CO2 emission and temperature change all over the years.


## Summary of Findings

From 2000 to 2022, the percetage of Renewables among the generation of electricity in Europe has been increasing.

The country with the highest percentage of renewables (in the selected european countries of this dataset) in elecricity generation is Norway, followed by Austria, Latvia, Croatia and Sweden. If we look at the plot of prices, we can see that 2 of these countries, Norway and Sweden are also the countries with the lowest prices of electricity. Furthermore, looking at the main dataset we can see that most of the production of electricity is from hydropower in Norway.

The country with the higheste demand per capita is Norway, the same country with the higest pecentage of renewables and lowest wholesale electricity price. This high demand of energy can be due to the low temperatures of this country. Among the top 3 we can see they are all nordic countries.

CO2 emissions tend to decrease all ove the years. The country with the highest emissions is by far Germany. However this analysis in not very accurate because it should be emission per capita. Other interesting aspect is that in 2020 (pandemic year) the CO2 emission decreased significantly, not only in Germany but in general. It mus be due to the close of many industries.

In terms of temperature change all over the years of this study, in Europe, it seem to have a tendency of increasing.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The percentage of renewables in electricity generation is increasing all over the years, despite temperature change continues increasing too.
